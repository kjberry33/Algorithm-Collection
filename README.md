# Algorithm Reference Repository

Welcome to the Algorithm Repository! This repository is a collection of algorithms across various domains, organized for future reference and practice. Whether you’re a student, a professional developer, or just a coding enthusiast, this repository aims to provide valuable resources and practice opportunities. All the examples are encoded entirely in Java!

## Contents

This repository is structured into multiple categories of algorithms, each of which is implemented in different programming languages. Below is a brief overview of each category:

## Categories

Geometric Algorithms: Algorithms related to geometry, including computational geometry problems and solutions.

Searching Algorithms: Algorithms designed to search for elements in data structures, such as linear search, binary search, and more.

Sorting Algorithms: Algorithms for arranging elements in a specific order, including various sorting techniques like bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort.

String Algorithms: Algorithms for string manipulation and analysis, such as pattern matching and text processing.

Tree Algorithms: Algorithms that operate on tree data structures, including traversal algorithms, search algorithms, and balancing algorithms.
